## Log Entries

### Entry 1: Data Understanding & The Duplicate Row Discovery (Phase 1)
- **Date:** October 5, 2026
- **Question Raised:** What does the raw KDD Cup 1999 10% dataset actually contain? Can we use standard random splitting as-is?
- **Observation / Finding:** 
  - The dataset has no header row; 41 features plus 1 label column (42 columns total) were parsed from `kddcup.names.txt`.
  - Raw row count is exactly 494,021 with 0 NaN values.
  - Raw labels end with a trailing period (e.g., `normal.`, `neptune.`), which must be stripped before processing.
  - A staggering **70.53% of rows (348,435 out of 494,021)** are exact duplicates across all features and target label.
  - Duplicate density varies wildly across attacks: `smurf` has 280,149 duplicates (99.77% duplicate rate!), `neptune` has 55,381 duplicates, and `normal` has 9,447 duplicates. In contrast, rare attack types like `buffer_overflow` (30 rows), `loadmodule` (9 rows), `perl` (3 rows), and `rootkit` (10 rows) have zero duplicates.
- **Action Taken:** Strip trailing periods from labels, map attack types to the 5 major families, and deduplicate prior to any train/test split.
- **Impact on Results:** Total dataset size collapses from 494,021 down to 145,583 instances.

### Entry 2: Label Mapping & Conflict Resolution Rules (Phases 2 & 3)
- **Date:** October 5, 2026
- **Question Raised:** What happens if identical feature vectors have different labels? How should ties and conflicts be resolved?
- **Investigation & Rules Formulated:**
  1. **Exact Duplicates:** Identical feature vector AND identical label $\rightarrow$ keep first occurrence (348,435 rows removed).
  2. **Conflicting Labels:** Identical feature vector but DIFFERENT attack family $\rightarrow$ ambiguous threat signals; drop the entire conflict group (2 rows removed).
  3. **Same Family, Different Attack Name:** Identical feature vector and same target family, but differing sub-attack names (e.g. `portsweep` vs `satan`) $\rightarrow$ keep first occurrence because the macro family target is unambiguous (1 row removed).
  4. **Constant Columns:** Confirmed that `num_outbound_cmds` and `is_host_login` have zero variance (`nunique() == 1`, all values 0). Both columns were dropped.
- **Verification:** Built a 6-row synthetic unit test (`make_synthetic`) in `notebooks/data_preparation.ipynb` validating that exact duplicates, family conflicts, and same-family sub-attack ties behave exactly as specified.
- **Resulting Post-Cleaning Family Counts (145,583 total rows):**
  - **Normal:** 87,831 rows
  - **DoS:** 54,571 rows
  - **Probe:** 2,130 rows
  - **R2L:** 999 rows
  - **U2R:** 52 rows (extreme rarity; 10 rows in a 20% test split)
- **Saved Artifact:** Exported `data/processed/dedup_summary.csv` tracking before/after/removed counts for all 23 attack types.

### Entry 3: The 99.96% Fake Leakage Demonstration (Phase 4)
- **Date:** October 5, 2026
- **Question Raised:** What actually happens if someone trains a decision tree on raw, non-deduplicated data with a standard random 80/20 train/test split?
- **Experiment:** Trained a default `DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)` on raw split vs. cleaned deduplicated split.
- **Empirical Results:**
  - **RAW (Leaked) Data:**
    - Test row contamination: **72,652 out of 98,805 test rows (73.53%)** appeared word-for-word in the training set!
    - Raw Test Accuracy: **99.96%**
    - Raw Test Macro-F1: **0.9333**
    - Honest evaluation (filtering out the 73.5% leaked rows): Accuracy dropped, demonstrating that the apparent "near-perfect" score was an illusion created by row memorization rather than generalized attack pattern recognition.
  - **CLEAN (Deduplicated) Data:**
    - Test row contamination: **0 rows (0.00% overlap)**.
    - True decision tree baseline Macro-F1: ~0.91.
- **Key Takeaway for Report & Video:**
  - This is our central empirical proof for Section II: **"If a model looks 99.96% perfect, you should be deeply suspicious."** High raw accuracy was driven entirely by memorizing repeated `smurf` and `neptune` flood packets.

### Entry 4: Stratified 80/20 Train/Test Split & Leakage Assertions (Phase 5)
- **Date:** October 5, 2026
- **Question Raised:** How do we partition the data so rare classes are representative and test data remains completely uncontaminated?
- **Design Decisions:**
  - Stratified 80/20 split based on the 5-family target:
    - **Train Set (80%):** 116,466 rows (Normal: 70,265; DoS: 43,657; Probe: 1,704; R2L: 799; U2R: 42)
    - **Test Set (20%):** 29,117 rows (Normal: 17,566; DoS: 10,914; Probe: 426; R2L: 200; U2R: 10)
  - Saved split indices to disk (`data/processed/train_idx.npy`, `data/processed/test_idx.npy`) and recorded metadata in `data/processed/split_meta.json`.
  - Locked the test set: created `load_train()` and `load_test()` in `src/data.py` so subsequent modeling and EDA phases strictly ingest `X_train, y_train, meta_train`.
- **Integrity & Fault Injection Tests (`src/validate.py`):**
  - Verified index disjointness (`intersection == 0`).
  - Verified exact row union (`union == 145,583`).
  - Proved zero feature vector leakage (`row_overlap(X_train, X_test) == 0`).
  - Verified that fault injection tests (injecting intentional overlap or missing indices) raise `AssertionError` and pass break tests.

### Entry 5: Upcoming Phases 6–10 Roadmap Decisions
- **Date:** October 5, 2026
- **Architecture Freeze:**
  - Phase 6 EDA will be conducted exclusively on `load_train()` to prevent data snooping.
  - Phase 7 will build `FeatureEngineer` and `ColumnTransformer` inside scikit-learn `Pipeline` objects to prevent CV fold leakage.
  - Phase 8 will construct the evaluation harness (Macro-F1, binary FPR/FNR) and benchmark the Dummy baseline (M0).
  - Phases 9 & 10 will train and evaluate Logistic Regression (M1) and Decision Tree (M2) on identical 5-fold CV splits.
